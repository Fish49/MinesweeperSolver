# MinesweeperSolver
MinesweeperSover is a clever python bot that can quickly solve Minesweeper!

!IMPORTANT! This code interacts with your mouse and captures the entire content of your screen multiple times a second. If you havent set your computer up corectly for the bot to run, and even sometimes if you have, it will click all over your computer and probably ruin something.

!IMPORTANT! At any point, hit ESC to stop the program. If you arent fast enough, it could mess with your computer and click all over the place. use this bot at your own risk.

So far ive only tested this bot on a 1920x1080 screen on Windows 11. chances are it wont work on any other screen size or OS, since it uses precise pixel coordinates to check the state of the screen and do the clicking.

To use it, you must go to https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=minesweeper and set googles zoom size to 100%. when using, make sure that the program is calibrated correctly to find and access the board on your screen, and make sure the difficulty is correct. If you have made any changes regarding calibration, color, or pixel values, you must use the "Custom" difficulty profile. make sure that you calibrate custom to exactly match your setup.

(Yes I know ive made the bot sound really scary but in theory, it shouldnt mess anything up. if it doesnt detect a minesweeper board, chances are it wont do any clicking. Just remember, in the event of an emergency, click ESC)
